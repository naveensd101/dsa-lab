## assignments

---

1. Binary Trees
	1. Paranthesis Representation of Binary tree
	2. Find cousins
	3. Number of sum BSTs in a big Binary tree
	4. BST (mainly level btw my level func is bad u can do better)
	5. Ksmallest in a BST
	6. Make balanced BST from given assend order list
2. Hash Table + BST
	1. Open Hashing with Quadratic Probing and Double Hashing
	2. Hashing with Chaining (strings)
	3. Special anagram (strings)
	4. AVL Tree (skip)
	5. KLargest and KSmalles in BST
	6. BST, Largest element in the path between two elements
	7. Making Balanced BST with a sorted list of keys

3. Balancing BSTs

## tests

---

1. Datastructures lab test part 1
    1. Stack using fixed size array
    2. Reverse the string using a Stack
    3. Modify Stack Function

2. Datastructure lab test part 2
	1. Position of an elem in an unsorted SLL
	2. Return the (n-k+1)th node in the SLL
	3. Insert elem to the middle fo a DLL

3. Offical test 1
	1. BST duplicate count and level print
	2. two keyed 3 array search tree (couldnt complete implementations, my code is not complete)
	3. Didnt reach that question while attending test
